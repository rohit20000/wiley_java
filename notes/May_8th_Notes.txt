data -> database 

write a query get the data  -> 30 mins
logic -> 30 
display -->  30 mins 

30 mins extra








------------------
count number of  nodes

- top view
- I face problem in solving problem where we have to find if TWO TREE are equal, How to traversal  in such case.
- construct tree from two given traversals
- level order traversal
- height of the tree
- depth of the tree
- lowest common ancestor
- Vertical order traversal
